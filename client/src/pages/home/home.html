        The objective of Chain Reaction is to take control of the board by
        eliminating your opponent's orbs.
      </p>
      <p class="text-sm text-gray-600 font-medium my-4">
        Players take it in turns to place their orbs in a cell. Once a cell has
        reached critical mass the orbs explode into the surrounding cells adding
        an extra orb and claiming the cell for the player. A player may only
        place their orbs in a blank cell or a cell that contains orbs of their
        own colour. As soon as a player looses all their orbs they are out of
        the game.

          Rules of the Game
        </header>
        <p class="text-sm text-gray-500 my-2">
          Chain Reaction is a deterministic combinatorial game of perfect
          information for 2-8 players. The gameplay takes place in an
          <i><b>m</b> x <b>n</b></i> board.
        </p>
        <p class="text-sm text-gray-500 my-2">
          For each cell in the board, we define a critical mass. The critical
          mass is equal to the number of orthogonally adjacent cells. That would
          be 4 for usual cells, 3 for cells in the edge and 2 for cells in the
          corner.
        </p>
        <p class="text-sm text-gray-500 my-2">
          All cells are initially empty. Players take turn to place "orbs" of
          their corresponding colors. Aplayer can only place an orb in an empty
          cell or a cell which already contains one or more orbs of their color.
          When two or more orbs are placed in the same cell, they stack up.
        </p>
        <p class="text-sm text-gray-500 my-2">
          When a cell is loaded with a number of orbs equal to its critical
          mass, the stack immediately explodes. As a result of the explosion, to
          each of the orthogonally adjacent cells, an orb is added and the
          initial cell looses as many orbs as its critical mass. The explosions
          might result in overloading of an adjacent cell and the chain reaction
          of explosion continues until every cell is stable.
        </p>
        <p class="text-sm text-gray-500 my-2">
          When a cell explodes, the surrounding cells with opponent's orbs are
          converted to player's color and the other rules of explosions still
          follow.
        </p>
        <p class="text-sm text-gray-500 my-2">
          The winner is the one who eliminates every other player's orbs.
